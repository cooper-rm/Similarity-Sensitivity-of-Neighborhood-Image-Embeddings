# Similarity-Sensitivity-of-Neighborhood-Image-Embeddings
This project investigates how image embedding groups formed by similarity change as the number of nearest neighbors (k) in a neighborhood varies in a vector space search. Using image embeddings as a test domain, it explores the empirical sensitivity of local groupings when compared against a full NÃ—N similarity baseline.
