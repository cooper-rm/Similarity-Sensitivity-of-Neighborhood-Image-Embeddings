### Similarity-Sensitivity-of-Neighborhood-Image-Embeddings

This study investigates how neighborhood size (k) influences similarity-based groupings within image embedding spaces. Using open-source image datasets and ResNet embeddings, we empirically quantify how local neighborhood structure changes relative to a full 𝑁 × 𝑁 similarity baseline, characterizing the sensitivity of unsupervised similarity search to k-limited neighborhood construction.
